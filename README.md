## Hi! I'm Pream ðŸ‘‹
<p align="center">
 I am a final-year student and expected to graduate this June. Iâ€™m excellent at communicating with new people and flexible. Iâ€™m outstanding at organizing and planning. I like to use a to-do list to prioritize tasks and have applied for organizing people and projects to all aspects of my work.
